Need docker
After running setup.sh file, need to run build/SqlScripts/FoundationConfigurationSchema.sql and build/SqlScripts/UniqueCouponSchema.sql in the Commerce database manually as mssql-tools do not exist in the azure-sql-edge docker image ( currently, cannot use mssql/server:2019 image as it does not support arm64 architecture )
